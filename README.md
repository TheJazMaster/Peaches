# Eddie, the Electrician 0.9.6
A work-in-progress Cobalt Core mod. **Requires [Kokoro](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/tree/master/Kokoro)**.

Take this lazy snake for a spin and play around with **infinite cards**, **X-costs**, **hand/energy management** and **big attacks**.

![Sprite of the character, their name and frame](https://github.com/TheJazMaster/Eddie/Sprites/47794482/243962cf-0edb-44ab-92b6-f296f8b6f26c)
![Eddie, your ship's electrician. Their cards offer flexible ways to spend, store and gain energy.](https://github.com/TheJazMaster/Eddie/Sprites/47794482/2fdf9b3b-0b41-45a4-b185-62262c3e6b0e)

Huge thanks to **Arin** for doing the character sprite, border and card frame, and for design advice.

All visuals (and lack thereof) beside those are placeholders and will most likely be changed before 1.0.0. Dialogue will also be added for 1.0.0 or after.
